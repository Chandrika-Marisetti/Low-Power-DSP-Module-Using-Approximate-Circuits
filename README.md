# Low-Power-DSP-Module-Using-Approximate-Circuits
This project explores the design and implementation of low-power Digital Signal Processing (DSP) modules using approximate computing techniques. It is aimed at achieving energy-efficient computation for signal processing tasks without significantly compromising output accuracy.
ðŸ§  Project Objective
To develop and evaluate low-power MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) and other DSP modules using approximate arithmetic units such as:

Approximate Adders (e.g., LOA, ETA, Hybrid Adders)
Approximate Multipliers
Hybrid Approximate-Exact Designs
